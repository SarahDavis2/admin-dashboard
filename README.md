# Admin Dashboard
The Admin Dashboard uses HTML and CSS. The purpose of this project is to practice using only CSS Grid.

## Reflection
- I would have mapped out the layout on paper before creating as I had to rewrite some of the code after realizing I needed to format the code a specific way to let CSS Grid work properly.
- Recently, I have created the base layout in a different file through more iteration and it has gone much smoother than approaching in a mich wide scale format initially.
- Also I need to work more on using CSS selectors than complicated class names in the html.
