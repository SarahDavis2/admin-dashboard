# Admin Dashboard
The Admin Dashboard uses HTML and CSS. The purpose of this project is to practice using only CSS Grid.

## Reflection
I would have mapped out the layout on paper before creating as I had to rewrite some of the code after realizing I needed to format the code a specific way to let CSS Grid work properly.
